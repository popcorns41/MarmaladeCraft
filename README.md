# MarmaladeCraft
html,css,Javascript and PHP ecommerce website with a MySQL backend database I worked on for a client that never fully launched.

This project was for a local ecommerce seller of face masks during the covid pandemic, the client requested the website be created without the help of any web development kits.
As this was deemed best viable for low traffic website to reduce development costs.

Noteable functions:

1. The website supports mobile compatibility with Javascript animated hamburger icons (feature is best implemented on the homepage)
2. The catalogue allows for sorting of items based off of user preference.
3. Orders and sales affect the backend database, adjusting total purchases made. 
4. Website implements a SHA-256 standard encrytion for password protection, implemented by a PHP external library.
5. A mail agent was created for the website, allowing confirmation of orders and sign ups to be sent as emails to a user.
